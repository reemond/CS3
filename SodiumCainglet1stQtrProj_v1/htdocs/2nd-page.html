            school from kinder 2 to grade 6. My hobbies are cooking, playing badminton, and eating of course.</a>
        <a class="y">My birthday is on September 20, 2007; which means I'm currently 15. I have 2 best friends, Stephanie
            and Gab, they were both my classmates in elementary, but have split up in high school and we have been 
            friends for about 7 years now. I love them with all my heart and I could trust those two with my life.</a>
