			Before we learn my experiences here in high school, let me introduce myself properly first. I was born and raised from the great of city of General Santos. I went to GSC Sped Integrated school from kinder 2 to grade 6. My hobbies are cooking, playing badminton, and eating of course.<br><br>
			My birthday is on September 20, 2007; which means I'm currently 15. I have 2 best friends, Stephanie and Gab, they were both my classmates in elementary, but have split up in high school and we have been friends for about 7 years now. I love them with all my heart and I could trust those two with my life.
